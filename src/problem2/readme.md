## Problem 2

This is my take on currency exchange form using pure HTML/CSS (I thought it would be fun and challenging at first, turns out it was not). With the time constraint and limited methodologies, this is the best I can pull off. There's still a lot I can do for this, but that would likely end up with me breaking everything and rebuild from start. Hopefully the take can showcase my front-end programming capabilities.

Time taken: 1 day
